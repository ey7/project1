# Code Institute Milestone 1 project

## Victoire Market
 Build a website for the Code Institute User Centric module. I have chosen to build a website for a retail shop in Cork, Ireland. 

 ## Design Planning

A planning document for the website can be found here which details the planning of the UX and UI. I used Figma here for the intial website design of the homepage.

  - The website advertises a retail shop, Victoire Market, that sells Afro-Caribbean products (food, hair and beauty).
  - The aim is for an attractive, simple easy to use website that advertises the products available in distinct categories.
  - Contact information is readily available, with well planned navigation and a contact page.

## Website content

The website consists of five pages, including a homepage, three product pages and a contact page.

## Website Style

- One colour theme of blue throughout for visual consistency. 
- A modern sans serif font of Exo 2 throughout.
- An off white background with dark grey text for optimum readability.

## Website Features

- Visually attractive sliding carousel on homepage to advertise products.
- Responsive navigation with "hamburger" drop down menu icon for small screens.
- Contact form where users can contact for further information.

## Technologies used

- CSS Grid and Flexbox for website layout and design.
- Bootstrap for modern styling with responsive navigation, carousel slider and product cards. 
- Google fonts for fast loading on Exo 2 font.
- Font Awesome for social media icons
- Jquery and Popper Js for Bootstrap functionality.
